TURTLE RACE
This is a simple turtle race game built using Python's `turtle` graphics module. In this game, six turtles race across the screen, and the player bets on which turtle they think will win.

HOW IT WORKS:
1.The game presents a prompt asking the user to choose which turtle (by color) they think will win the race.
2.Six turtles of different colors are placed at the starting line, and they begin moving forward by random distances.
3.The race continues until one turtle crosses the finish line.
4.If the userâ€™s chosen turtle wins, they win the game; otherwise, they lose.

FEATURES:
-6 Turtles**: Each turtle is of a different color (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple).
-User Input: The user bets on which turtle will win.
-Random Movement: Turtles move a random distance between 0 and 10 each time.
-Game Outcome: After a turtle crosses the finish line, the game tells the user whether they won or lost.
